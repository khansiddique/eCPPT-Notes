Low Hanging Fruit
	Misconfigured Servers
	Unimplemented or badly implemented ACLs
	Default or weak passwords
	Open SMB Shares / Null Sessions
	Broadcast Requests
	Vulnerabilities related to public exploits

NCrack
	Brute forcing tool that can use its own wordlist or hav a wordlist specified
	Can be used with NMAP so the ports it will look for information are already shown on the NMAP scan
Within NMAP export the results utilizing the -oN command
From there then feed that into ncrack with the -iN command and give a username and password wordlist
NCrack will automatically look at the NMAP scan and try to find the ports that it can crack, and then attack those ports on the target machines (you can have more than one IP address in the report)

EyeWitness
	Used to help identify low hanging fruit as it applies to web applications and networking devices
	Can figure out if default credentials are being used on HTTP and HTTPS enabled ports
	Can be downloaded on github
		./setup.sh
	to use:
		python EyeWitness.py --headless --prepend-https -f urls.txt (this can either be urls or IP addresses)
	When scan completes it will generate a HTLM report with its findings
	Also contains --active-scan with will actively try to log in (be careful of account lockouts)

Rsmangler
	Used to generate a wordlist out of a few words (utilizes variations and permutations)
	make a wordlist (just a couple of words, maybe 2 to three words)
	cat wordlist.txt | rsmangler --file - > wordlist_new.txt
	You will see that very quickly the wordlist will increase and give you everything that could possibly be from those few words

CeWL
	Scrapes a targets website and creates a wordlist
	cewl -m 8 http://example.com
		The above example will pull all words with a minimum value of 8 characters (wordlist will be 8 or more characters)
