NMAP Zombie Scanning

Utilize a zombie to scan systems that are not allowed to be scanned by other systems
We can use this to bypass firewalls / ACLs, or not release our IP address when scanning a system

First we need to find a zombie machine
To do this we need to use the -O option
ex:
	nmap -O -v -n 10.10.10.10
The -O will look at the operating system and we want to see if IP ID sequence Generation is Incremental
If so we can use that machine as our zombie machine
Now find an open port on that zombie machine
	Regular nmap scan on zombie machine
From there we can scan other systems through out zombie machine
ex:
	nmap -Pn -sI <zombieIP:port> <targetIP> -v
In the above example we do not want to send pings from our machine (our original machine no the zombie)
We are then using a zombie IP and port, which is told with -sI
we can also do any other scans we want 
ex
	nmap -Pn -sI 10.10.10.10:135 10.10.10.9 -p- -vv -sC -sV 
We can also use just the -p option to look at a single, or a few ports


NMAP Bounce Scan

Allows us to use FTP Bounce Attack, which utilizes the FTP server to access other machines on the internet and can conduct scans 
	on networks that we may not have access to (internal networks)
To do this we have to use the -b option in nmap
Any scan utilizing the -b option will look like it originated from the FTP server, thus hiding us

NMAP Firewall Rules

To test the rules of firewalls we can use the -sA option within NMAP
You can inspect the packets even further if you also run wireshark
