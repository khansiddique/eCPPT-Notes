	ZAP

Burp Suite allows for
	Interception of requests and responses between browser and web server
	build requests manually
	crawl a website by automatically visiting every page in a website
	fuzz web applications by sending them patterns of valid and invalid inputs to test behavior

Configuring Burp Suite

Burp Repeater
	lets you manually build raw http requests
		provides the following
			syntax highlighting
			raw and rendered responses
			integration with other Burp tools
	Can also be used to try different usernames and passwords (along with username and password parameters for hydra)
	Repeater is used to show how an application will behave with different parameters

You can also set a target that will allow you to just attack that one target

Turn on Server response intercept
	Proxy
	Options
	Intercept Server Reponses (make sure it is clicked to go through burp)
 
Add items to scope to only intercept those URLs

When intercept is off, burp will still get information from HTTP pages

Within Target Sitemap black words are pages you have actually gone to
The grey pages are ones that burp found on its own

To have burp crawl a target you can use the spider tab
	Spider is free on older versions of Burp, however, newer versions it is not

There a a couple of labs that you should do for Burp Suite, especially if you have never used it before.
