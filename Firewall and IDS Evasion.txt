Firewall / IDS Evasion

nmap -sS -f <targetIP>
	-sS excutes a syn scan
	-f tells nmap to fragment packets
Cannot use -f with -sT or -sV
We can also use --mtu
	This is specify a custom offset size
	Offsets must be in a multiple of eight

A way to fool analysts is by using decoys
Decoys only work if they are up and running
Should not send traffic from one at a time, however all of them should go at the same time
This then hides the attackers IP with the decoy IPs to make it harder for analysts to know who attacked them

nmap -sS -D <decoyIP>, <decoyIP2>, <decoyIP3>, ME <targetIP>
ME specifies to nmap where to put your IP address for your Kali machine
If you do not specify NMAP will put you in a random spot

You cannot use decoy with -sT or -sV

TIMING

To evade detection you may use timing
	-T0 paranoid   5 min
	-T1 sneaky     15 sec
	-T2 polite     0.4 sec
	-T3 normal     default
	-T4 agressive  10 millisec
	-T5 insane     5 millisec

Can also use max retries to not retry too many times
	--max-retries 1

SOURCE PORT

We can change the source port to utilize ports that are allowed by a firewall
Most firewallys allow port 53, so we could use that and run a scan

nmap -sS --source-port 53 <targetIP>
nmap -g 80 -sS <targetIP> 

Notice -g can also be used instead of --source-port
