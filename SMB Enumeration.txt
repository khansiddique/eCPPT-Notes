NULL SESSIONS

These are some of the oldest attacks against SMB 
They are used against Windows NT and Windows 2000
Null Sessions return information without any authentication process

To see if system is vulnerable to null session on Windows
net use \\<ipaddr>\IPC$ "" /u:""
If the command is completed successfully it is vulnerable

In the above command we have a empty (anonymous) username and no password
