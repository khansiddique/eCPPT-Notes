SNMP ENUMERATION

Four types of SNMP commands used
	Read
	Write
	Trap
	Traversal Operations
Works on UDP ports 161 and 162

SNMP attacks
Flooding
Community
Brute Force

Easiest way to obtain community string is to sniff SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 traffic
Both utilize clear text communications

After getting in to a system there are many tools that can be used
snmpwalk (part of net-snmp suite)

ex:
	snmpwalk -v 2c <targetIP> -c public
	
	-v verbose
	2c is the version that is being used by SNMP
	-c sets the community string to public

If you get some weird iso.x.x.x.x.x hardware: 
do the following
install snmp-mibs-downloader
comment (#) the fourth line in /etc/snmp/snmp.conf

	snmpset (a tool used to request to either set or change information on a network entitiy)

NMAP SNMP TOOLS
	NMAP comes with a few built in scripts for SNMP
	snmp-brute
	snmp-info
	snmp-interfaces
	snmp-netstat
	snmp-processes
	snmp-sysdescr
	snmp-win32-services
/usr/share/nmap/scrip$ ls -l | grep -i snmp

nmap -sU -p 161 --script=<script_name> <ipAddr>

nmap --script-args snmp-brute.communitiesdb=<wordlist> 
	a wordlist you can use:
		/usr/share/seclists/Misc/wordlist-common-snmp-community-strings.txt
